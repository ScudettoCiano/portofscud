      "End-to-end machine learning project for employee churn classification, employee income regression, and segmentation clustering. Achieved top ranks in faculty Kaggle competitions.",
    fullDescription:
      `This thorough machine learning project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence & Fundamentals of Data Science coursework, involving predictive modeling across three distinct analytical tasks: customer churn classification, employee monthly income regression, and employee segmentation clustering. Working with complex datasets requiring extensive preprocessing and feature engineering, I implemented multiple algorithms and ensemble methods to achieve optimal performance. The classification model utilized RandomUnderSampler with GradientBoosting and SMOTE with RandomForest ensemble to effectively handle severe class imbalance in the churn prediction dataset. For monthly income regression analysis, XGBoost delivered superior performance through careful hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. The clustering component employed AgglomerativeClustering combined with PCA for dimensionality reduction to identify meaningful employee segments and behavioral patterns within the workforce data.`,
